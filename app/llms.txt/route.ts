> ${SUMMARY}

${BRAND} builds waterless (cold-air nebulising) diffusers and the fragrance oils
that run in them. A waterless diffuser atomises oil directly using air pressure
— no water, no heat, no dilution — so a room receives the fragrance at full
strength with its top, heart and base notes intact. An ultrasonic diffuser, by
contrast, vibrates a few drops of oil through a tank of water and delivers
roughly 1–3% fragrance in humidified air.
