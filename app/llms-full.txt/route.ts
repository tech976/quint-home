This is the expanded companion to ${abs("/llms.txt")}. Everything below is the
site's own copy, reproduced in full.

## How the products work

A waterless (cold-air nebulising) diffuser atomises fragrance oil directly using
air pressure. There is no water, no heat and no dilution, so the room receives
the oil at 70–90% concentration with its top, heart and base notes intact and
the scent holds for hours. An ultrasonic diffuser instead vibrates a few drops
of oil through a tank of water, delivering roughly 1–3% fragrance in humidified
air. Every ${BRAND} diffuser is waterless.

## Commercial terms

- All prices in Indian rupees (INR, ₹).
- Ships within India only, from Mumbai.
- Shipping is free at ${inr(FREE_SHIPPING_FROM)} and above, otherwise a flat ${inr(SHIPPING_FLAT)}.
- Every diffuser includes one complimentary 50 ml oil, chosen by the buyer on the diffuser's page.
- Oils are IFRA-compliant.
