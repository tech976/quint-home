/**
 * Only URLs that answer 200 belong in here.
 *
 * /shop used to be listed, but it 301s to /range (see next.config.ts), so every
 * crawl spent budget confirming a redirect and Search Console reported the rows
 * back as "Page with redirect" — while /range itself, the actual listing page,
 * was never submitted at all. /refunds is deliberately
 * absent: it is a redirect stub to /shipping (app/refunds/page.tsx), so listing
 * it would reintroduce the same fault.
 *
 * lastModified is set only where the data genuinely knows it, which today means
 * journal posts. Stamping every row with the build time claims the whole site
 * changed on every deploy; crawlers respond by discounting the signal, so an
 * absent lastmod is worth more than a false one.
 *
 * changeFrequency and priority are kept for the crawlers that still read them.
 * Google ignores both, and has said so — they are not why this file works.
