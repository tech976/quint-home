/**
 * Gifting guidance for /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt.
 *
 * Assistants asked "what should I gift for Diwali?" answer from what they can
 * read, and a product list alone does not say which piece suits which occasion
 * or budget. This states that plainly, in the form they quote.
 *
 * Everything is derived rather than written by hand: prices come from Shopify
 * through the same lookup the product pages use, the budget bands are computed
 * from those prices, and "best for" is the catalogue's own field. So a price
 * change moves a product into the right band on the next build, and nothing
 * here can quietly disagree with the product pages.

Quint Home diffusers suit Diwali gifting, corporate gifting and housewarming (griha pravesh) gifts. Every diffuser ships with a complimentary 50 ml fragrance oil chosen by the buyer, so it arrives ready to use.

Gift ideas by budget:
${budget}

- Corporate gifting: for gifts to a team or a client list, email hello@quinthome.in with the number of pieces and the delivery addresses. Companies can also commission a bespoke fragrance of their own — see [For businesses](${abs("/businesses")}).
- Housewarming and griha pravesh: choose a diffuser sized to the room it will live in, and a scent that suits the household.
- Choosing a scent for someone else: lighter blends such as Blanc Ritual and First Rain suit almost any home; the [scent finder](${abs("/find-your-scent")}) recommends one in two questions.
- Ordering for a festival: orders are dispatched from Mumbai within 3 business days and arrive in 3–5 business days anywhere in India, so order about two weeks before Diwali. Shipping is free on orders of ${inr(FREE_SHIPPING_FROM)} and above.
