// The order awaiting payment, kept on the Shopify cart.

// It used to live in a thirty-minute browser cookie, and then the order could
// only be written by that same browser coming back in time. A customer who
// paid by UPI and never returned to the tab, or returned in a different
// browser, left a captured payment with nothing to attach it to.
//
// The cart is already server-side and already holds the lines, so the rest of
// the order goes there too:
//
//   attributes  the delivery details, and the transaction they were given for
//   note        where settlement has got to: nothing, in progress, or done
//
// With the cart id carried inside the payment (see encodeCartRef), any process
// that hears a payment succeeded can rebuild the whole order — no cookie, and
// no browser, required.
