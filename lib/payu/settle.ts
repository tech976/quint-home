// Turns a PayU payment into a Shopify order — once, whoever asks.
//
// A success is announced several ways: the customer's browser is sent back to
// us, PayU notifies us server-to-server, the customer refreshes the page, and
// staff can ask for a payment to be looked at again. Any of them may arrive
// first, any of them may never arrive, and two may arrive together. They all
// call settlePayment, which holds to three rules:
//
//   1. PayU decides whether it was paid. Not the browser.
//   2. One payment makes one order, however many times this runs.
//   3. A captured payment always leaves something in Shopify. If the proper
//      order cannot be written, a placeholder is, with the reason on it.
//
// Rule 3 is the one that was missing. Every check here used to end in a log
// line and a shrug when it failed, and a log line is not somewhere a shop
// looks for a customer who has paid.
