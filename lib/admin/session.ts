 * log into this store's Shopify admin can finish it. Rather than keep a session
 * store, the cookie is a value signed with the app secret — the same secret
 * Shopify signs its own callbacks with — so it cannot be forged without it.
 *
 * The check runs in a server layout rather than in proxy.ts: the Next docs are
 * explicit that proxy should be a last resort, and a layout keeps the decision
 * next to the pages it protects. Every /admin page is dynamic for this reason,
 * so nothing protected is ever prerendered into the CDN.
