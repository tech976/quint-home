// marked as paid, so Shopify stays the source of truth for orders, inventory,
// customers and fulfilment — without the payment passing through Shopify
// Checkout (which is what attracts the third-party transaction fee).
//
// Requires a custom app token with `write_orders` (and `write_inventory` if you
// want stock decremented).
//
// Everything here runs after the money has been taken, which sets the rule for
// the whole file: a captured payment always ends up as an order in Shopify.
// If Shopify will not take the order as the customer placed it, it is written
// with less; if it will not take that either, a plainly-labelled placeholder
// goes in its place for a person to finish. What never happens is nothing.

 * The bag was gone, or had changed, or Shopify refused every form of the
 * order — but the money is in, and the worst outcome is a payment nobody at
 * the store knows about. So it is recorded where orders are looked for: one
 * custom line for the amount received, tagged for attention, with everything
 * known written into the note.
 *
 * A custom line touches no variant and no stock, and no receipt is sent, so
 * there is very little here for Shopify to object to. If it objects to the
 * address or the email anyway, the order goes in without them; they are in
 * the note regardless.
